Kickstarter Analysis Wright Up


Overview of Project
This project analyzes how different campaigns fare in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals with a focus on theater.  Excel is used in this analyses to present the data collected in a way that makes these trends easily interpretable.  
Analysis and Challenges
Analysis:
In Excel a pivot table was made to organize the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns by month and used to make the line graph in Figure 1.
Figure 1

 
Next a table a table was made to compare the percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns for different ranges of goals which is represented through the line graph in Figure 2.

Challenges:
The one difficulty I had was some confusion about using the year function that was supposed to be used to make the year column.  We were supposed to use this to make the year column for the pivot table, however we wanted to look at the months.  I ended up just converting it from unix time with the date function and used it as is.  
Results

Conclusions:

From Figure 1 it can be seen that the best time of year to release campaigns is around May for them to be successful.  Also Figure 2 shows that campaigns that have a goal of $1000 or less are more likely to succeed.  

Limitations:

There are many more things that go into starting a campaign than were analyzed in this project that prevents the full picture from being seen.  Also analyzing only some of the data can cause a misleading conclusion.  

Recommendations:

It could be useful to make line graphs comparing the number of backers and amount pledged to successful, failed, and canceled campaigns.
